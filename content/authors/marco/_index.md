I am a Software Engineer at Google. I work on making Google Chrome easy to change, hard to break, and ship efficiently.

I also recently graduated from Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN. My research interests while attending Vanderbilt have focused around artifical intelligence, particularly natural language processing and machine translation.
